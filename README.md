# Step by step with React and Redux

The purpose of this book is to provide a step-by-step guide on how to develop a single page application with modern tools such as React and Redux with all the associated tooling.

It is like setting up a carpentry workshop.  You know how to hit a nail, turn a screw or saw a piece of timber, but when you want to actually set up your workshop you start to find out that there are lots of ancillaries that are required, the more so if you are going to work with other people and for other people.

We won't dump a ready-made setup on you from the start, we will go one step at a time explaining why each one is needed.  We won't cover absolutely all the possibilities that exist, they are too many, but if you know why we choose a particular option, you will have a base to compare it with the alternatives.

This book is available in [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/book-react-redux) in several electronic formats and printable PDF. The original can also be read directly from this very same [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Satyam/book-react-redux/tree/master/manuscript).

## Sample code for each chapter

Sample code for each successive chapter can be displayed by selecting it from the <kbd>Branch: **master**</kbd> dropdown list at the top left of the file listing box.  

Once a chapter (branch) is selected, the full code for that chapter can be downloaded as a compressed `.zip` file with the <kbd>Download ZIP</kbd> button.

The whole repository can be cloned, provided you have a local git client software installed by doing:

`git clone https://github.com/Satyam/book-react-redux.git`

That will create a `book-react-redux` folder under your current working directory.  Change to that directory

`cd book-react-redux`.

For your local copy to be aware of the material in each chapter, do

`git pull`

That will retrieve the information about all the branches (chapters) available.

To list the chapters and their stages available, do

`git branch`

You can see all the work at any stage for any chapter just by doing:

`git checkout chapter-nn`

## Suggestions and Feedback

This being a collaboration site, it makes sense to use its very own tools to get feedback.  Just go to the [Issues](https://github.com/Satyam/book-react-redux/issues) tab and file any comment or suggestion.  The repository is also open to accept edits right into GitHub which can then be revised, discussed and merged into successive editions.

Thanks in advance for any such help.
